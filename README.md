# Casino-Number-Guessing-Game
Introduction

  This C++ program implements a simple casino‚Äêstyle number guessing game. The computer seeds its random number generator using time(NULL), then picks a secret number between 1 and 50. The player repeatedly enters guesses until they find the correct number, receiving feedback on whether each guess is too high or too low. The program also tracks and displays the total number of attempts made.
